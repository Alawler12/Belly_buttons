## Belly Button Biodiversity

The purpose of this project was to use Plotly to visualize data collected to analyze the prevalence and type of bacteria found inside a sampling of belly buttons.  We used JavaScript to manipulate and visualize the data in the browser console, and then used Plotly to create interactive charts to allow users a quick reference to the prevalence of certain belly button bacteria.  

I created an interactive bar chart, bubble chart, and an indicator gauge to visualize the data collected on each subject.  The subjectâ€™s ID number is chosen from a drop-down menu, causing their demographics to be displayed and the charts to display their individual bacterial results.

Html was also used to create a webpage to publish the results.  I modified the given challenge code to add an image to the jumbotron, changed the layout of the charts on the page, and customized colors and fonts.  The website was published using GitHub Pages.
